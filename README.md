## Description

Get Fit Bit By Bit is a sample exercise tracking website which takes in user submitted exercise data to provide a small selection of charts for visual data consumption. The website also includes a variety of motivational quotes, and an exercise suggester for users to assist in their fitness growth. Unlike many other fitness trackers, this website also allows the user to individual sets of strength training reps (e.g., push-ups, sit-ups etc).
